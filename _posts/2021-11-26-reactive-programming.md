excerpt: Until recently, enterprise grade applications hosted on tens of servers, respond in seconds and need hours of offline maintenance and they are subject to gigabytes of data. Whereas due to high utilization rate, data traffic throughout digital channels to servers reached level of petabytes. To meet these demands organizations need systems that are more robust, more resilient, and more flexible. So today’s applications are running on lots of platforms from mobile devices to cloud-based virtual servers that have thousands of multi-core processors. In addition, a paradigm emerged in systems domain began to take more place in technology architecture: Reactive Systems

IT organizations have the responsibility to rationalize business outcomes with technology driven services to fulfill customer needs. With the prevalence of digitalization and mobile devices, customers are able to consume digital resources more and more using these technology-enabled services. They expect systems to respond in degree of milliseconds and 100% availability. Applications designed with conventional architectural patterns cannot overcome these challenges.

Until recently, enterprise grade applications hosted on tens of servers, respond in seconds and need hours of offline maintenance, and they are subject to gigabytes of data. Whereas due to high utilization rate, data traffic throughout digital channels to servers reached level of petabytes. To meet these demands organizations need systems that are more robust, more resilient, and more flexible. So today’s applications are running on lots of platforms from mobile devices to cloud-based virtual servers that have thousands of multi-core processors. In addition, a paradigm emerged in systems domain began to take more place in technology architecture: **Reactive Systems**

According to the Oxford Dictionary, there are two main definitions for the term reactive:
{% include pullquote.html quote="Showing a response to a stimulus." %}
{% include pullquote.html quote="Acting in response to a situation rather than creating or controlling it." %}
