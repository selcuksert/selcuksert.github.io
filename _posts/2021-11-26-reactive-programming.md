excerpt: Until recently, enterprise grade applications hosted on tens of servers, respond in seconds and need hours of offline maintenance and they are subject to gigabytes of data. Whereas due to high utilization rate, data traffic throughout digital channels to servers reached level of petabytes. To meet these demands organizations need systems that are more robust, more resilient, and more flexible. So today’s applications are running on lots of platforms from mobile devices to cloud-based virtual servers that have thousands of multi-core processors. In addition, a paradigm emerged in systems domain began to take more place in technology architecture: Reactive Systems

IT organizations have the responsibility to rationalize business outcomes with technology driven services to fulfill customer needs. With the prevalence of digitalization and mobile devices, customers are able to consume digital resources more and more using these technology-enabled services. They expect systems to respond in degree of milliseconds and 100% availability. Applications designed with conventional architectural patterns cannot overcome these challenges.

Until recently, enterprise grade applications hosted on tens of servers, respond in seconds and need hours of offline maintenance, and they are subject to gigabytes of data. Whereas due to high utilization rate, data traffic throughout digital channels to servers reached level of petabytes. To meet these demands organizations need systems that are more robust, more resilient, and more flexible. So today’s applications are running on lots of platforms from mobile devices to cloud-based virtual servers that have thousands of multi-core processors. In addition, a paradigm emerged in systems domain began to take more place in technology architecture: **Reactive Systems**

According to the Oxford Dictionary, there are two main definitions for the term reactive:
{% include pullquote.html quote="Showing a response to a stimulus." %}
{% include pullquote.html quote="Acting in response to a situation rather than creating or controlling it." %}

As the definitions tell themselves, anything that is reactive needs an external cause or trigger to become active. Based on that context, a reactive system simply keeps up a perpetual interaction with its environment (e.g. human intervention, physical environment, other reactive systems, etc.). As an example, heat energy comprising of a heater and a switch to activate/de-active it is a reactive system that has the ability to react to the user who switches on/off.

The two scientific papers [1][2] that coined the concept of reactivity in system domain also underline that reactive systems have to behave under sequence of events or states, which may also be endless in length.

Reactive systems behave different from computational systems. Programs for computational systems produce some subsequent value upon terminating itself with transforming input into an output, which should be unique. Therefore, non-termination is not an option. Instead, programs for reactive systems perform computation via reacting to impetuses from the environment that they interact. They should work with a non-termination mode. The output they produce do not have to be unique. The input deliberately defines the response of systems in terms of status, actions and outputs as per the nature of reactive systems.

Reactive systems propose a resilient and robust architecture for distributed systems as per their design model. That is why they are increasingly taking place in areas where critical tasks are being performed, massive, unpredictable input occurred, and failure is intolerable such as e-commerce, aviation (e.g. air-traffic management systems, electronic control systems), etc.
